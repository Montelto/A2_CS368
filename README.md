 book, deleteBook() to delete a book, findBook() to find a group of books by
  year, calculateAverageRating() to get the average rating of the database
  , print() to print the database, bookIDSort() to help sort by ID
  , bookYearSort() to help sort by year, bookRatingSort() to help sort by
   rating, sortDB() to sort the database by sorting method.

' - printing database, 'a' - adding book with int 'ID', int 'year' and double
 'rating', 'd' - deleting book by int 'ID', 'u' - update book with int 'ID
 ', int 'year' and double 'rating', 'c' -  calculate average rating of
  database, 'f' - find books by year with int 'year', 's' - sort database
   with int 'sorting method', and 'q' - quiting the program.
